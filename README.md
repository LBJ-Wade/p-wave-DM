This directory contains everything that is needed to reproduce the results
and figures in the p-wave dark matter paper.

Assuming you have all the necessary dependencies installed, you should be able 
to run 'python analysis.py', followed by 'python plotter.py'.

The analysis script should generate the upper limits, while the plotter code
will put the figures into the plots/ folder.
